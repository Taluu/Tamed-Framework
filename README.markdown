====================================
A lightweight and fast MVC Framework in PHP, easily extensible.

Features
========
- MVC
- Entirely OOP
- Routing support
- HTTP Request & Response support
- Compatible with every View Engine... As long as the bridge implements correctly the interface (PHP & Talus' TPL bridges made)
- Easily Extensible
- Homemade ORM (not made yet)

Requirements / Dependencies
===========================
- PHP 5.3+
- [Talus TPL](https://github.com/Taluu/Talus-TPL), if it is used as the view engine

Credits
=======
- The routing mechanism is built with the help of [CapMousse](https://github.com/CapMousse)
- The Response mechanism is greatly inspired from [Symfony 2](https://github.com/symfony/symfony)
